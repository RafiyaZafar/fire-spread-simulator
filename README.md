# fire-spread-simulator

### Description  
Fire Spread Simulator is a React-based simulation game that visualizes the spread of fire across a forest. The game uses a grid where cells can be in one of three states: tree, burning, or empty. The simulation shows how fire spreads from burning trees to adjacent trees.

### Features  
-Dynamic simulation of fire spread  
-Customizable grid size and simulation speed  
-Color-changing heading effect to enhance visual appeal  

### How to Play
