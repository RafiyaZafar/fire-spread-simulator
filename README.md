# fire-spread-simulator

Fire Spread Simulator is a React-based simulation game that visualizes the spread of fire across a forest. The game uses a grid where cells can be in one of three states: tree, burning, or empty. The simulation shows how fire spreads from burning trees to adjacent trees.

Features
-Dynamic simulation of fire spread
-Customizable grid size and simulation speed
-Color-changing heading effect to enhance visual appeal

How to Play
-Click the Start button to begin the simulation.
-The fire will spread through the trees, turning them into ashes.
-Adjust the settings to see how different conditions affect the fire's spread.
